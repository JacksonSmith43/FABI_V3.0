# Welcome to FABI

The FABI (Flexible Assistive Button Interface) allows control of a computer’s mouse cursor and
typing desired keyboard keys by using buttons and special/individual input methods. It can be
helpful for people who cannot use standard computer input devices – enabling them to play
games, surf the internet, write emails and much more.

## How?

The FABI Interface can be actuated via dedicated buttons, momentary switches or self-made
electrical contacts. FABI consists of a hardware module (a low-cost microcontroller which behaves
as a computer mouse and/or keyboard) and a graphical software application for configuration of
the desired functions.

## Documentation
The following documentation is available in this repository:
* **Construction manual**: manual for building the hardware parts of FABI.\
See [English version of construction manual](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/ConstructionManual/3D-printedBox/en/FABI_ConstructionManual.pdf) or [German version of construction manual](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/ConstructionManual/3D-printedBox/de/FABI_Bauanleitung.pdf)
* **Software User Manual**: manual for the application that configures a FABI device ("FABI-GUI").\
See [English version of user manual](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/FABI_GUI_Manual/en/FABI_UserManual.pdf) or [German version of user manual](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/FABI_GUI_Manual/de/FABI_AnwendungsAnleitung.pdf)
* **DIY Building Guide**: guide for creating FABI boxes or buttons apart from the standard 3D printed parts. See [DIY Building Guide](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/ConstructionManual/SelfmadeBox/FABI_Construction_SelfmadeBox.pdf)

## Where should I start?

Available documentation is listed above. A configured FABI module can be used on any
computer (Windows, Linux or Mac) without installation of special software, because the FABI
module behaves exactly like a standard mouse and keyboard which is plugged into your computer.

Nevertheless, for configuring the desired functions via the GUI application a driver installation is
necessary. The driver installation is also explained in the software user manual.
FABI is an open source Assistive Technology module developed by the AsTeRICS Academy
Project of the University of Applied Sciences, Technikum Wien
(see http://www.asterics-academy.net).

All software and hardware documents are open source and we took care to use the most
affordable components available on the market to establish these functionalities – making FABI the
most reasonably priced flexible assistive button interface we know !!


## Example applications

The folder _case designs_ contains different acrylic glass designs for example applications.
Some of the examples are also located in the wiki.
