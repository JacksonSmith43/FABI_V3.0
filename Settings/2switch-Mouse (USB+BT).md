## Basic information
This configuration is optimised for 2 switches (connected to inputs 1 and 2)
It allows mouse pointer control on a PC/Mac/Laptop computer (USB-mode) 
and on a mobile device (iOS/Android, BT-mode).
 
Default mode is: USB
Button1 is used for moving the mouse in a given direction,
Button2 is used for changing the direction (short press) or the device mode (long press).
Left mouse clicks are performed automatically after a short period of inactivity (dwell clicking).
For double/right mouse clicks, a click selection tool (e.g. click2speak) can be used.
