## Basic information
This configuration is optimised for 3 buttons (connected to inputs 1, 2 and 3)
It allows mouse pointer control on a mobile device (e.g. Android) via bluetooth (BT-mode).
 
Button1 is used for moving the mouse pointer in the given direction.
Button2 is used for clicking the left mouse button.
A long press of Button2 creates a keyboards sequence for the Home-Key on many Android devices (GUI+Backspace).
